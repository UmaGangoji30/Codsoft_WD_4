            <li>She was born on <b><u>26 August 1910</u></b>
                in place called <b><u>Anjeze Gonxhe Bojaxhiu</u></b>,
                later on they but moved to India when she was 18 years old.
            </li><br>

            <li>She was the youngest child of Nikolle and Dranafile Bojaxhiu (Bernai). 
                Her father, who was involved in Albanian-community politics in Ottoman North Macedonia, 
                died in 1919 when she was eight years old. He was born in Prizren (today in Kosovo), 
                however, his family was from Mirdita (present-day Albania).

                In <u><b>1979, Mother Teresa received the Nobel Peace Prize</b></u>"for work undertaken in the struggle to overcome poverty and distress, 
                which also constitutes a threat to peace".<br>

                * She refused the conventional ceremonial banquet for laureates, asking that its $192,000 cost be given to the poor in India and saying that earthly rewards were important only if they helped her 
                to help the world's needy.<br>
                <br>
                <b>* When Mother Teresa received the prize she was asked, " What can we do to promote world peace "?</b><br>
                * She answered, "Go home and love your family." Building on this theme in her Nobel lecture, she said: "Around the world,
                not only in the poor countries, but I found the poverty of the West so much more difficult to remove.<br> 
                * When I pick up a person from the street, hungry, I give him a plate of rice, a piece of bread, I have satisfied.
                I have removed that hunger.But a person that is shut out, that feels unwanted, unloved, terrified,
                the person that has been thrown out from society that poverty is so hurtable  and so much, and I find that very difficult."

               <b>She was the Founding of the Missionaries of Charity</b>
                With unwavering determination, Mother Teresa established her first mission in Kolkata, India in 1950. 
                * The Missionaries of Charity provided care, love, and support for those living on the streets, abandoned children,
                lepers, and people dying from diseases like HIV/AIDS.
            </li><br>
            <li>Mother Teresa founded the Order of the Missionaries of Charity, a Roman Catholic congregation of women dedicated to the poor,
                 particularly to those in India, that opened numerous centres serving the blind, the aged, and the disabled.
            </li><br>
            <li>
                In 1997, her worsening health forced her permanent retirement, and the order chose an Indian-born nun, 
                Sister Nirmala, to replace her. Mother Teresa suffered cardiac arrest and died on <i><u><b>September 5, 1997, in Kolkata,</b></u></i>
                just days after her 87th birthday.
